# First, you need to launch the simulator environment
# Here we assume that...
#   the server IP address is 127.0.0.1; that 
#   the server LISTENS on port 5156, meaning that the clients must PUBLISH to 5156
#   the server EMITS from port 5155, meaning that clients must SUBSCRIBE to 5155
# Then, to launch a bee and a CASU (only one directional):
python spawn_eg.py -svr 127.0.0.1 -pp 5156

# and to execute the bee behaviour:
python bee_wander.py -bn bee-001 -pp 5156 -sp 5155

# press <ctrl-c> to exit, and it should halt the bee in place.

# no CASU behaviour is defined as yet.

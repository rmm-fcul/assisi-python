# First, you need to launch the simulator environment
# Here we assume that...
#   the server IP address is 127.0.0.1; that 
#   the server LISTENS on port 5156, meaning that the clients must PUBLISH to 5156
#   the server EMITS from port 5155, meaning that clients must SUBSCRIBE to 5155
# 
# Note: to set this up, if you have at least rev 30de0b2 then you can use the config
# file `Playground_N.cfg` to initialise the server appropriately:
#
cp ./Playground_N.cfg <playground_dir>
cd <playground_dir>
./assisi_playground -c Playground_N.cfg
# alternatively, you can use the command-line options
./assisi_playground --pub_addr tcp://*:5155 --sub_addr tcp://*5156

# Then, to launch a bee and a CASU (only one directional):
python spawn_eg.py -svr 127.0.0.1 -pp 5156

# and to execute the bee behaviour:
python bee_wander.py -bn bee-001 -pp 5156 -sp 5155

# press <ctrl-c> to exit, and it should halt the bee in place.

# no CASU behaviour is defined as yet.
